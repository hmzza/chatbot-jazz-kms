To generate HTML code for a basic website, you can follow these general steps:

1. **HTML Structure**: Start by creating the basic structure of your HTML document. This includes defining the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, setting the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.
2. **Head Section**: In the `<head>` section, you can include metadata such as the title of your webpage, character encoding, and any CSS or JavaScript files that will be used on your site.
3. **Body Section**: In the `<body>` section, you can add content to your website using HTML elements like headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.), paragraphs (`<p>`), images (`<img>`), and links (`<a>`).
4. **Add Content**: Add the actual content you want on your website, such as text, images, or videos.
5. **Save and Test**: Save your HTML file and test it in a web browser to ensure that everything is working as expected.

Here's some sample HTML code for a basic webpage:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Basic Website</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Basic Website!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image on my website">
  <a href="#">Link to another page</a>
</body>
</html>
```
Please note that this is just a basic example, and you can customize your HTML code as needed.
