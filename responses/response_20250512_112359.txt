Question: what is the best offer in terms of data? list only one
Response: I'd be happy to help!

Since you're looking for the best offer in terms of data from the Jazz ROX category, I'll review my internal knowledge base. After analyzing the offers, I found that all the offers listed under the Jazz ROX category have a similar description, which is "Test Data".

However, if I had to recommend one offer based on its features, I'd suggest Offer ID 1765 from the Jazz ROX category. Although the details are limited due to the test data nature of these offers, this particular offer seems to be focused on providing consumable data.

Here's a summary of the offer:

* Category: Jazz ROX
* Offer ID: 1765
* Offer Category: Prepaid
* Consumable Data: Test Data
* Charges: Test Data
* Incentive: Test Data
* Validity: Test Data
* Time Window (Usage Hours): Test Data
* Is Recursive: Test Data
* Is Prorated: Test Data
* Subscription Code: Test Data
* Unsubscription Code: Test Data
* Offer Description: Test Data
* USSD String: Test Data
* Base Rate: Test Data

Please note that the details are limited, and I couldn't find any specific information about the data amount or speed. If you're looking for more detailed information, I'd be happy to help you with that once you provide me with more context or specific questions!
