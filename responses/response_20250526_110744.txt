Question: what is best package for data usage
Response: Hi!

For B2C customers, our top recommendation for heavy data users is the "Monthly Internet - Heavy" offer (Category: B2C). This postpaid plan offers 180 GB of consumable data at an affordable rate. If you're looking for a prepaid option, we have another "Monthly Internet - Heavy" offer that provides the same amount of data.

Would you like more details?
