Question: i want to see offer which has 1 gb of data
Response: I'd be happy to help! You're looking for an offer that provides 1 GB of data. I can suggest a few options based on our internal knowledge.

We have a Monthly Browser recursive offer that catches my attention. It's a B2C (Business-to-Consumer) offer, and it provides 1 GB of data in just Rs200 - All Taxes Included!

To activate this offer, you can dial the USSD string *441*37 or use the base rate *441*37.

As I mentioned earlier, this is a Monthly Browser recursive offer. Since you're interested in getting 1 GB of data, I think this could be a great option for you!
