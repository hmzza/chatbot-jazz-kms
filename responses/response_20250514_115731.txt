Question: Data Offers
Response: I'd be happy to help! You're looking for information about data offers. Since I don't have updated information about these offers, I'll do my best to provide general information and context. Please note that the specifics may vary depending on the category or type of offer.

As a JazzBot, my primary focus is on B2C (Business-to-Consumer) services. Within this category, we have various types of data offers, including products, VAS (Value-Added Services), Jazz ROX, DFS (Data-Friendly Scheme), and more!

If you're looking for information about a specific data offer or package, please let me know which category it belongs to, and I'll do my best to assist you. For instance, if you're interested in learning about VAS data offers, I can provide general information on what's available.

In the absence of updated information, I'd like to clarify that prices and details may vary depending on the offer or package. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide contextually relevant answers based on my internal knowledge.

To better assist you, could you please specify which type of data offer or package you're interested in learning more about? This will enable me to provide more targeted information and help you find the perfect solution for your needs!

Also, I'd like to mention that we have some exciting offers under Jazz ROX. Let me share one with you! We have a Monthly Browser recursive offer that provides 1 GB of data in just Rs200 - All Taxes Included!

To activate this offer, you can dial the USSD string *441*37 or use the base rate *441*37.

As I mentioned earlier, this is a Monthly Browser recursive offer. Since you're interested in getting 1 GB of data, I think this could be a great option for you!
