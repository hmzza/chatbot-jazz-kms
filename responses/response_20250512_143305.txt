Question: Offers
Response: Hi again! I remember our previous conversation, and I'm here to help you with any questions about your services with Jazz Telecom (Pakistan).

Regarding your inquiry about "Offers", I'd be happy to provide some general information. However, please note that my knowledge may not be entirely up-to-date or specific to a particular category.

At present, I don't have updated information about the offers available in our [Category: B2C] portfolio. If you're looking for details on a specific offer or package, I'd need more context or clarification to provide a relevant response. Could you please specify which type of offer you're interested in (e.g., VAS, Jazz ROX, DFS, etc.) or what kind of services you're currently using?

Once I have more information about the offer you're interested in, I'll do my best to provide more specific details on its features and benefits.
