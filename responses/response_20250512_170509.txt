Question: Offers
Response: I'm happy to help! Since I don't have updated information about the offers, I'll do my best to provide general information and context. Please note that the specifics may vary depending on the category or type of offer.

As a JazzBot, my primary focus is on B2C (Business-to-Consumer) services. Within this category, we have various types of offers, including products, VAS (Value-Added Services), Jazz ROX, DFS (Data-Friendly Scheme), and more!

If you're looking for information about a specific offer or package, please let me know which category it belongs to, and I'll do my best to assist you. For instance, if you're interested in learning about VAS offers, I can provide general information on what's available.

In the absence of updated information, I'd like to clarify that prices and details may vary depending on the offer or package. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide contextually relevant answers based on my internal knowledge.

To better assist you, could you please specify which type of offer or package you're interested in learning more about? This will enable me to provide more targeted information and help you find the perfect solution for your needs!
