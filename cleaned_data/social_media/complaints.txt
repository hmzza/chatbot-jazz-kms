Required Questions: I don't have updated information about this.
Important Points: <ul>
	<li>Don&rsquo;t use search by customer location for prepaid numbers since we have very limited search count available against location and we can also use Postpaid Data CDR for searching data</li>
	<li>We need to mention/ask customer&rsquo;s other contact number in all complaints &rarr; We need to guide customer about 0308-4400333 call back NDC</li>
	<li>Where customer location is of any areas of Azad Kashmir/Rawla Koat then there is no need to consult Static Map/SSO Portal however we can launch the complaint by mentioning exact location after verifying complete check list</li>
	<li>We have observed few complaints where there is No Balance/No remaining MB&rsquo;s but we have acknowledged the complaint so we need to check Balance/Remaining MB&rsquo;s first properly</li>
	<li>If customer facing issue regarding video downloading need to check customer balance as downloading will be charged on base rate while having Social bundle, Monthly sms bundle data</li>
	<li>In few cases we are guiding customer to remove Cache/Cookies and restart handset without system consultation</li>
	<li>If customer is facing issue regarding specific application we should guide customer to reset/reinstall application (WhatsApp, FB, You Tube etc.)</li>
