	<div>&nbsp;</div>
	</li>
</ul>

Required Questions: I don't have updated information about this.
Important Points: <ol>
	<li>Incase customer changes his/her mind and calls again to edit pending request before bill run then we will cancel pending request and will launch new request</li>
	<li>This process is not applicable on new Bolt-on addition and only applicable where already provisioned bolt-on needs to be changed. Means, bolt-on/Add-Ons can be added during month if not provisioned already</li>
	<li>If we are converting package to any other package then to make the call complete it is mandatory to guide the customer that he will not be able to revert it back before 24 hours (To Be changed in Improvement)</li>
	<li>At time of processing any Change of Package Plan order, every time it is mandatory to confirm if customer wants to continue using existing FNF Numbers (if any). Incase customer wants to carry forward the previously added F&amp;F numbers then it is mandatory to ask the previous F&amp;F numbers and update them again, as there is a possibility that previously added F&amp;F numbers will be deleted in case of Change in package plan .</li>
	<li>Incase customer wants to change the FNF then we will process edition as per existing process</li>
	<li>We need to check security deposit and credit limit before changing customers package plan. For e.g. if customer is using J 100 and now wants to change his package to J 1500, we need to check customer credit limit and if it is not sufficient then no instructions will be forwarded.</li>
	<li>While changing Postpaid Package Plan, it is mandatory to click on Add item after selecting required package, so the package plan is properly added</li>
	<li>We need to guide the tariff details (call charges etc.) of new package plan</li>
	<li>We need to guide the customers that line rent &amp; free minutes/MBs etc. will be calculated on prorated basis and will also be applicable from the date of package plan changed</li>
	<li>While converting package plan from M-initial to any other package we need to guide customer that package plan to M-initial cannot be reverted if oacakge plan is on commercial catalog</li>
	<li>On calls where we process postpaid change of package plan, we need to check if customer was previously availing any Add-On (e.g. M-Talk, GPRS 1,2, 3 or 4,M-SMS, FNF etc.). If yes, then we need to clearly probe if customer wants to keep availing the same add-on in new package and then cater request accordingly. For Example: If a customer on M-999 with GPRS-3 wants to convert package to M300 then we clearly need to inform customer that in J-300 package, GPRS-3 cannot be availed. If customer wants to have zero line rent GPRS then, with proper customer&rsquo;s consent, we need to provision default GPRSM-300 while changing packaging from J-999 to J-300</li>
	<li>Incase eFront activity cancellation rights are not available with CCRs then we will escalate activity cancellation request to Team Leader via Siebel Escalation activity in eFront</li>
	<li>Add-on can be activated upfront in Siebel any time during billing cycle</li>
	<li>We need to select required package/bundle from list. Mentioning in notes will not activate/deactivate any package/bundle</li>
	<li>Incase customer wants to get multiple actions performed then we need to create separate activity for each action</li>
	<li>Please note that this activity is not for deactivation of Bundles. Incase customer requests for deactivation of a bundle then instructions will be processed directly in Siebel (guide proration impact)</li>
	<li>Incase error received on eFront activity then we will facilitate customers upfront via Siebel and mention &ldquo;Activity error&rdquo; in order notes for reference (for successful activity creation customer must be on Consumer Catalogue with J Series or M Series package)</li>
	<li>Please check Siebel for package/bundle already active. In few cases requests were launched where package/bundle was already active</li>
	<li>In case number is on commercial catalog then customer need to visit office for Change offer via Biometric (under &ldquo;Internal to External&rdquo; on BMD)</li>
	<li>Bundle deactivation request need to be processed upfront (inform about pro-ration impact clearly). Please do not create eFront activity for deactivation</li>

	<li>Complete notes will be entered in the same number.</li>
	<li>If number is resumed from Write-off reason and the customer has paid the full deposit as per the package plan but has not cleared the write-off amount, then CREDIT OPERATIONS will initiate the case to the concerned for additional payment for Write-off adjustment.</li>
	<li>Credit limit of the numbers activated with temporary waiver codes are not enhanced until the additional deposit is paid.</li>

		<li>Incase line items are Available: Will follow the below process&nbsp;
		<ul>
			<li>We need to cancel the pending order.&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For Cancel/Submit a Pending Order in Siebel we need to route the activity of Action Required  Order Error from our login to any Fellow Team Member and then route back the activity on our own Siebel login (owner ID), after which cancel/submit option will become enabled.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: In case any activity is routed to any person other than our team member OR even to our Team Leader then we will not be able to reroute that activity to our login.</p>

<ul>
	<li>After cancellation of order, new order needs to be created and previous request needs to be processed in same order (as per confirmation from customer)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: It is mandatory to check our own pending orders before shift end, in case any order is not submitted we need to submit order on daily basis.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Awaiting for Approval: CRM team TBD</strong></p>

<p>PFB handling for orders in Awaiting for Approval status where line detail status reflect in pending status. Please note that we will not cancel such orders and follow the below guidelines:</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Postpaid Stuck Orders (To be Verified,Open)- Billing Failures cases</strong></p>

	<li>Auto restoration is not applicable on this collection path. Before restoration following checks needs to be taken</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Deposit should be as per Package plan</li>
	<li>In case of write off, write off amount should be cleared&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Pending dues should be cleared</li>
	<li>For Ex-employee package plan Rs.1000 Security deposit is required.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>IR access will be disbaled at the time of restoration on deposit release &amp; write off.</p>

Required Questions: I don't have updated information about this.
Important Points: <ul>
	<li>No restoration on commitment is taken in this scenario.</li>
	<li>DNR-B2C collection path should be checked. Auto Restoration in this scenario is not applicable. All the checklist must be followed.</li>
	<li>In case any postpaid number is suspended on Deposit Released (suspension reason in CSRTB is reflecting as &ldquo;Deposit Released&rdquo;) then we need to refer to blocking notes and ledger properly</li>
	<li>Consult system CSRTB for billing details of Postpaid number.</li>
	<li>Guide customer to pay his outstanding if any and ask for security deposit amount as per package plan &nbsp;prior to resume number</li>
	<li>ECE will ask customer to clear write off amount along with deposit as per Package plan.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Implementation of RPA/BOT (automated system)</strong></p>

<p>CNC team has implemented BOT(automated system)&nbsp;for Deposit released &amp; write-off restoration cases.&nbsp;BOT will resume only those cases where below scenarios will be True and accurately provided</p>

<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Collection path = DNR_B2C<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;C&amp;C is not Null<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Deposit paid as per package plan<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Write off amount cleared if any</p>

<p>Therefore, for change of collection path for conversion or termination sufficient security deposit need to be available to avoid any undue financial exposure</p>

<ul>
	<li>Please be informed that&nbsp;for the DNR Restoration Tasks\waiver issuance for Pre to post during Ramadan. Team will handle these tasks from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm, and on Friday from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm.</li>
