	<li>We do not acknowledge Complaints for basements and Higher than 3rd Floor</li>
	<li>If Konnect shows Jammers in the Area then we need to inform customer that there are Jammers installed in the area and customer may face network issue at this location</li>
	<li>If any Network complaint is closed with Notes &ldquo;No further Redesign is possible&rdquo;, then we will not acknowledge same complaint for next 3 months and apologies with the customer suggested statement. However, if customer complaints for any other network related issue, we will acknowledge the complaint</li>
	<li>Guide customer to check auto-mode and if it is not on auto-mode then guide customer to check with auto-mode</li>
	<li>For number busy error on incoming calls(Party B), activation of ICS should be checked. In case ICS is active we will guide customer to change screening mode (Blacklist). If ICS is not active then guide customer that it is handset related feature</li>
	<li>For diverts cancellation, we need to guide ##002# along with processing HLR related - OMT Tab case in CSRTB&nbsp;(other than PCO/Dongle Service Class)</li>
	<li>IVR (short codes) connectivity related issues (except 230) will be catered as Operational complaint (coverage is mandatory)</li>

	<li>Guide Divert Cancellation code alog with forwarding Reset CF. If two cases&nbsp;are completed in super office&nbsp;and customers issue is not resolved then we will forward cellular complaint as pe SOP</li>
	<li>&nbsp;If party B number is with the customer then we can reset CF of B party after taking required verification</li>
	<li>&nbsp;If &ldquo;Powered off/Not Responding&rdquo; is reported on incoming calls from all numbers whereas number is switched on then we will guide customer regarding Manual network selection in first call and incase customer is facing Powered off/Not Responding issue after performing manual network selection then we will create Incoming complaint as per normal PROCESS GUIDELINES</li>

				<p>For complaints where customer claims&nbsp; that they are successfully sending SMS but SMS is not received party B end.</p>

				<p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>It has been observed that when customers are using American handsets and after updating of software, it adds&nbsp;<strong>11</strong>&nbsp;before number. In this case SMS is successfully sent (also visible in Usage&nbsp;) but not received at&nbsp; party B end.</li>
					<li>If customer confirms&nbsp; such a case where customer&rsquo;s handset is appending &ldquo;11&rdquo; as prefix, ask customer to check if &ldquo;11&rdquo; is being appended only when customer sends message to B-Party who&rsquo;s number is saved in his/her contact list or when he/she manually types the B-Party number for SMS.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Remedy:</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>If error is true where customer is sending message to saved list then guide customer to re-build his/her contact list .</li>
					<li>Second remedy is to ask customer to factory reset handset or downgrade its software for issue resolution.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em><em>Important: &ldquo;Please ensure that re-building of contact list is always guided before asking customer to downgrade handsets Software</em>&rdquo;.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Common Example of American handsets are;</li>
				</ul>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Motorola XT1585/Motorola Droid Turbo 2,&nbsp;Motorola KF12937145/Motorola XT1662/Motorola Moto M,&nbsp;Motorola XT1254/Motorola XT1250 etc)&nbsp;</p>

				<p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>In case customer claims sending SMS but it&rsquo;s not received at party B end,&nbsp; there is a possibility of improper&nbsp;<strong><em>Service Center</em></strong><em>&nbsp;<strong>Number</strong></em>&nbsp;saved in customer&rsquo;s handset;&nbsp; this error can be modified after software/firmware upgrade.</li>
					<li>However, in case where&nbsp;<strong><em>Service Center</em></strong><em>&nbsp;<strong>Number&nbsp;</strong></em>is not properly saved<strong><em>,&nbsp;</em></strong>It is observed that there will be no record/CDR&nbsp; generated due to invalid SC-number where no message is submitted to SMSC.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Remedy:</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>In this case please guide customer to modify the&nbsp;<strong><em>Service Center Number</em></strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;92300000042&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong>or simply<strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;92300&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;by checking through the settings of its default messaging App in handset.</li>

				<p><strong>Scenario 3:</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>There are situations where outgoing SMS issue is related to&nbsp;<strong>Anti-spamming&nbsp;</strong>policy which can be handled upfront by frontend agents with proper probing.</li>
					<li>It has been observed that customers are complaining about outgoing SMS issue, when customers are sending same text/content on different numbers which exceeds allowed Limits on Jazz network.&nbsp;<em>Example: &nbsp;&ldquo;Good Morning&rdquo; send to 400 contacts in 15 mins, this is spamming.</em></li>

Network Provider: Jazz
Complaint Description: <p>Incase customer contacts Jazz for VoWiFI activation / Deactivation or Complaint then we will follow below guidelines:</p>

Submission Channel: 1044
Escalation Level: I don't have updated information about this.
Created By: sabeeha.riaz
Type (SOP/Complaint): Complaint
Verification Status: 18
Point of Contact: I don't have updated information about this.
Frequently Asked Questions: <ul>
	<li>What&rsquo;s the difference between Wi-Fi Calling and VoLTE?
	<ul>
		<li>VoLTE uses LTE network, while Wi-Fi Calling uses your Wi-Fi network for extended network coverage and enhanced voice &amp; SMS experience</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Will there be any additional charges for Vo-Wifi services?
	<ul>
		<li>Vo-Wifi charging regime will follow VoLTE charging.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Will I be able to use VoWiFi if called-party is not VoLTE- or VoWiFi-capable?
	<ul>
		<li>Yes, you may still initiate calls and receive calls. However, the quality of call will not be in HD</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>I already have a Wi-Fi Calling icon on my phone, but I still cannot call or send a text message using a Wi-Fi network?
	<ul>
		<li>Make sure that the Wi-Fi network that you are connected to has an excellent signal strength and an internet speed of at least 100 kbps.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Can I use Wi-Fi Calling even if VoLTE switch is disabled on handset, or vice versa?
	<ul>
		<li>Yes. Wi-Fi Calling will still work even if VoLTE switch is disabled on handset. However, if VoLTE is disabled, your ongoing call will get disconnected if your handset has lost its Wi-Fi connection. For seamless/ uninterrupted call experience, please enable both Wi-Fi Calling and VoLTE services</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

Service Request Activity: <p><strong>VoWiFi Complaint Handling:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>We will follow normal network and deduction related complaint handling process to handle customer complaints</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Charging mechanism will remain the same i.e. free incentive will be used and incase no free incentive then base rate will be charged</p>

Checklist Items: <ul>
	<li>Volte is pre-requisite to use VoWiFi</li>
	<li>WiFi is available in selected handset (list attached)</li>
	<li>Latest software in handset (Android 12 &amp; above )</li>
	<li>Software built in hndset supporting VoWiFi</li>
	<li>VoWiFi enabled in handset</li>
	<li>Sim must be in WiFi enabled handset</li>
	<li>Good Wifi network (100Kbps speed)&nbsp;You may also conduct an Internet speed-test via&nbsp;<strong>http://www.speedtest.net/</strong>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Sufficient balance/incentive for voice &amp; SMS subscription</li>
</ul>

<p>For Network complaints while using VoWiFi</p>

<ul>
	<li>Probe if VoWiFi symbol is visible or not before acknowledging complaint.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Agent will check customer handset if vowifi is supported&nbsp;<strong>(both prepaid and postpaid)&nbsp;</strong>and a wifi network available</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Kindly note, currently IOS (apple) does not support vowifi , hence it is mandatory to check handset eligibility before guiding customer about vowifi</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Probe if VoWiFi symbol is visible or not before acknowledging complaint</p>
	</li>
</ul>

Required Questions: I don't have updated information about this.
Important Points: <ul>
	<li>Vo-Wifi (Voice Over Wifi) are voice and video call standards over any Wifi</li>
	<li>The Voice over Wi-Fi (Vo-WiFi) service, also called Wi-Fi Calling, enables subscribers to use smartphones that support Vo-WiFi to make voice or video calls through any available Wi-Fi connection.</li>
	<li>Vo-WiFi Improves indoor coverage even where there is no jazz signals. Better call quality (Ultra HD Voice), faster call setup time, efficient use of Network resources and No extra app needed.</li>
	<li>VoWifi calls will be considered as normal calls. Hence default call tariff will apply on it and in case of incentives, consumption will be from DA.</li>
	<li>Vo-Wifi be not be available on International outbound roaming.</li>
	<li>Vo-Wifi feature are&nbsp;available to all existing VoLTE enabled handsets.</li>
	<li>Vo-Wifi works on both Prepaid &amp; Postpaid</li>
	<li>Current implemented VoLTE complaint handling procedures would be followed for VoWiFi as well so VoWiFi related complaints should be launched except quality of service related issues on public WiFi</li>
	<li>Complete visibility for VoWiFi is available in CX HLR Portal</li>
	<li>Currently there is no seperate visibility of VoWifi calls in CDR&rsquo;s to identify that customer is calling over GSM or VoWifi
	<ul>
		<li>Behaviour of VoWifi is same as VoLTE so there is no segregation of VoWifi at CDR visibility level or billing end.</li>
	</ul>

	<li>Don&rsquo;t use search by customer location for prepaid numbers since we have very limited search count available against location and we can also use Postpaid Data CDR for searching data</li>
	<li>Manual settings ISMS should be used at first attempt (OS wise)</li>

	<li>Where customer location is of any areas of Azad Kashmir/Rawla Koat then there is no need to consult Static Map/SSO Portal however we can launch the complaint by mentioning exact location after verifying complete check list</li>
	<li>We have observed few complaints where there is No Balance/No remaining MB&rsquo;s but we have acknowledged the complaint so we need to check Balance/Remaining MB&rsquo;s first properly</li>
	<li>If customer facing issue regarding video downloading need to check customer balance as downloading will be charged on base rate while having Social bundle, Monthly sms bundle data</li>
	<li>In few cases we are guiding customer to remove Cache/Cookies and restart handset without system consultation</li>
	<li>If customer is facing issue regarding specific application we should guide customer to reset/reinstall application (WhatsApp, FB, You Tube etc.)</li>
