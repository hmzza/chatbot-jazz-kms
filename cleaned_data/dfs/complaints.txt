Frequently Asked Questions: <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li><strong>As per KMS, it is mentioned that complaint will only be lodged, where customer has shared MPIN/OTP in fraud execution cases;</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>OTP sharing is not the condition, for each case where customer calls for fake transaction that is being executed from his account complaint would be locked in fraud execution tab. While completing the complaint header agent would ask customer the details shared by him with fraudster (OTP is one them) and would input accordingly.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li><strong>Please confirm, for cases where fraudster during the call pretends to be the relative or friend of the person to whom he is calling and he already knows the personal details like name, CNIC , residence etc. Will complaint be lodged, where customer transfers amount with his/her consent and no MPIN/OTP is compromised?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>As mention above, yes case would be locked in fraud execution TAB as customer become victim of social engineering.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li><strong>Also confirm, where customer has not received any fake call but amount (online payments &amp; merchant payments) has been deducted from JazzCash account and he/she has no idea of that deduction, will complaint be lodged?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes complaint would be locked once customer call helpline to report his grievance about unauthorized deduction from his account either through merchant payments of any other means. In case customer just calls helpline for information prospective no complaint would be locked in that scenario.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>If yes, please confirm what will be added in fraudster MSISDN TAB while registering complaint?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For case where customer did not received any fake call or case where customer is unable to share the number of fraud caller details it would be mentioned as &ldquo;<strong>Nil</strong>&rdquo;</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li><strong>In case, customer does not has JazzCash account but fraud is executed and amount is sent via retailer channel, will complaint be lodged? If yes, please confirm, which MSISDN is to be used for victim MSISDN?</strong></li>

<p>Yes complaint would be locked and caller number/ customer number who received call and sender amount via agent would be mentioned as victim.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li><strong>Also confirm, from where L3 verifications will be taken for registering complaints, if customer does not have account and amount is sent via retailer channel.</strong></li>

	<li>For each transaction, complaint will be registered separately.</li>

Frequently Asked Questions: <p><strong>Question:&nbsp;Auto-Fill issue&nbsp;: While linking their Payoneer Account on the new app , customers sometimes use the autofill option , which has the customer&rsquo;s pre-saved credentials . In such instances the App either crashes or routes the customer to the previous page .</strong></p>

<p><strong>Anwser</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear user, we are aware that multiple users have been complaining of failure to link the Payoneer account when using their pre-saved credentials. To avoid facing this issue, kindly type your username and password manually on the payoneer sign in screen and click on Sign In button to proceed. We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>

<p><strong>Question:&nbsp;OTP issue&nbsp;: The sign in process ends if the customer leaves the app to review the OTP messages separately</strong></p>

<p><strong>Anwser</strong>:&nbsp;Dear user, due to security reasons, the sign in process ends if you leave the app during the OTP stage of login. In order to successfully sign in to your payoneer account, it is suggested to view your OTP from the notification bar of your phone and enter it manually in the app. If you have put an app lock on your messages, kindly disable the app lock for messages to be able to view the OTP on your notification bar.</p>

	<li><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">This complaint management process will cover scenarios related to issues with EFU Hospitalization and OPD Plan.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Once insurance is subscribed amount cannot be reversed.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">If a customer complains about mis-selling, the agent will inform the customer that by providing digital consent, you have subscribed to the insurance.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">If the customer still insists that incorrect information was provided by the insurance representative, the agent will ask for the specific information or benefits shared with the customer. After validating the concern, if the issue is found valid, the agent will lodge a complaint and document the complete issue of mis-selling details in the complaint remarks.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">For all cases where complaint is still in pending state and complaint TAT is over follow Escalation to Backend process.</span></span></li>
